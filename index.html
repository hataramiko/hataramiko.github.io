					I developed the app independently from start to finish alongside my 
					university studies. My goal was to develop and publish an application for 
					Android with Unity, whilst improving my programming skills using C#. 
					The subject matter of the app is a combination of personal interests of mine – 
					namely maps, Japan, and license plates.

					A second-year university project, developed in a team of five. 
					My role was to design, create, and implement the game's UI. 
					This included working with Unity, as well as C# programming to support 
					UI functionality. I also took it upon myself to consider UX design.
				</p>
				<p>
					The assignment for the project was to create a 2D game by cloning 
					a classic arcade game. The concept for the game came from 
					<i>Time Pilot</i>, with heavy influence drawn from <i>Luftrausers</i>.

					A first-year university game project, developed in a team of four. 
					I was solely in charge of designing and creating all visuals for the game. 
					This included designing the UI & UX, character design, and sprite animation. 
					The assignment for the project was to develop a mobile game encouraging 
					healthy life choices. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The game got a special mention for the best visual execution from 
					representatives of Tampere based game studios attending the event in which 
					all the first-year game projects were presented.

				<p>
					I applied to and participated the game jam in the role of a developer. 
					In a team of five, and alongside another developer, I worked on the 
					functionality and other technical aspects of our game. To name something  
					specific, I worked on character movement and randomized object spawning 
					in C# with Unity, among other things.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of the game jam was to complete a working mobile game prototype 
					within four working days. However, due to the flow and limitations of 
					the event, actual hours allocated to work on the game were no more than 24h. 
					The theme set for the game jam was <i>Out of Control</i>.

				<p>
					I did this with a few goals in mind. First of all, I needed an online 
					portfolio. Second, I wanted to revisit and solidify my existing knowledge on 
					web development. Instead of using any of the readily available website 
					creation tools online, I wanted to write and deploy the site on my own.
				</p>
				<p>
					Moving forward, I intend to improve the site by adding content and 
					functionality, and by refining the design and styling. As an example, 
					I'm planning on adding a level of interaction through functionality with 
					JavaScript.
